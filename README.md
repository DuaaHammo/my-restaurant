# REVERSE SEARED CHUCK STEAK BRANDY PEPPERCORN SAUCE

#### Reverse seared chuck steak, a tougher cut of meat, is cooked in a low oven until tender and juicy and then seared to develop a lovely crust. Served with a creamy brandy peppercorn sauce, this is one of my favorite at-home date-night meals!

# VEGAN IRISH COFFEE WITH COCONUT CREAM & HAWAIJ


#### Hot coffee served with some good Irish whiskey, a sprinkle of hawaij, and a dollop of coconut cream for a truly delicious (and accidentally!) vegan Irish coffee.
